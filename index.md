## Course Information

**Instructors:** Luis A. Perez

**Time:** Mon, Wed & Fri 12:00 pm - 12:50 pm

**Course Description:** This course covers analysis of efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, dynamic structure manipulation, path-finding, fast multiplication, and other problems. It introduces algorithmic techniques such as recursion, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming. It develops the following tools for algorithmic analysis: correctness proofs, algorithm synthesis, and discusses issues in non-computability. This course also overviews non-deterministic algorithms, and develops techniques to classify computationally hard problems. The concept of non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-completeness is introduced, and basic issues related to NP-completeness are discussed. 

**Prerequisites:** COMP 280, MATH 131.

## Staff Contact

- The best way to reach the staff is by making a private post on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/north_carolina_at_state_university/spring2022/comp285/home).
- You may also reach Professor Perez by emailing him directly at [laperez@ncat.edu](mailto:laperez@ncat.edu) with any questions or concerns that you do not with to post to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/north_carolina_at_state_university/spring2022/comp285/home).

**Course Grade:** The course grade will be based on the following components:

- 11 Homework assignments: 40% (that is 4.444% per homework, see below)
  - The lowest **2** homework scores will be dropped, so each of your 9 graded assignments compromize 4.444% of the course grade.
- 1 Midterm Exam: 20%
- 1 Final Exam: 25%
- Participation/In-Class Exercises: 5%
- Weekly Quizzes: 10%
- Extra Credit: ~5%
