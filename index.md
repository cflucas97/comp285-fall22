## Course Information

**Instructors:** Chris Lucas

**Time:** Tue, Thurs 2:00 pm - 3:15 pm ET

**Course Description:** This course covers analysis of efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, dynamic structure manipulation, path-finding, fast multiplication, and other problems. It introduces algorithmic techniques such as recursion, divide-and-conquer, and dynamic programming. It develops the following tools for algorithmic analysis: correctness proofs, algorithm synthesis, and discusses issues in non-computability. This course also overviews non-deterministic algorithms, and develops techniques to classify computationally hard problems. The concept of non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-completeness is introduced, and basic issues related to NP-completeness are discussed. Finally, we integrate a career preparation module throughout the course and focus on resume-building, mock technical interviews, and general job application process. 

**Prerequisites:** COMP 280, MATH 131.

## Staff Contact

- The best way to reach the staff is by making a private post on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/l6fee1cmjpp5az).
- You may also reach me by emailing directly at [cflucas@ncat.edu](mailto:cflucas@ncat.edu) with any questions or concerns that you do not with to post to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/l6fee1cmjpp5az).

**Course Grade:** The course grade will be based on the following components:

- 10 Homework assignments: 40% (that is 4% per homework, see below)
  - The lowest homework score will be dropped, so each of your 9 graded assignments compromise 4.444% of the final course grade.
- 1 Midterm Exam: 20%
- 1 Final Exam: 25%
- Participation/In-Class Exercises: 5%
  - The lowest 5 in-class exercises will be dropped.
- Weekly Quizzes: 10%
  - The lowest two quizzes will be dropped, so each of your 9 quizzes compromise 1.111% of the final course grade.
- Extra Credit: \~5%

Below is the grading scale we will use to determine grades.
