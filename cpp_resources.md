## C++ Resources for Pre-Requisite Data Structures

A few of you asked during lecture for resources to brush up on some of the data structures that we will use in this class. Here's a few pointers that I've found particularly helpful.

- <2 minute video intros to [stacks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgFVgp_VCN8) and [queues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ligWuGbhUMY)
- [Data Structures & Algorithms in C++](http://160592857366.free.fr/joe/ebooks/ShareData/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms%20in%20C++%202e%20By%20Michael%20Goodrich,%20Roberto%20Tamassia%20and%20David%20Mount.pdf)
  - Section 5.1 covers stacks
  - Section 5.2 covers queues
  - Section 9.1 covers maps
  - Section 9.2 coveres hash tables
- [CLRS](https://edutechlearners.com/download/Introduction_to_algorithms-3rd%20Edition.pdf) (though far less accessible)
  - Section 10.1 covers stacks & queues
  - Section 11.2 covers hash tables


## General C++ Resources

- A lot of minor problems in C++ can be avoided or caught by simply coding with good style. What do we mean by good style? We mean using good names for variables, indenting your code correctly, etc. A great resource for this is [Stanford's CS106B Style Guide](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/resources/style_guide.html).
- Another good resource for C++ is this [general reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
- If you're already familiar with Python, you can try this [Python to C++ Guide](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/resources/python_to_cpp.html)


## Great Tutorials for Getting Started with C++

Another approach you can take is finding great tutorials for getting started with C++ and simply walking through them, doing them.

- Learn C++ by example! [cppbyexample.com](https://cppbyexample.com/) is a great resource if you're completely new to C++ or just unfamiliar with the syntax! It's full of useful examples, like:
  - [How to add to an array](https://cppbyexample.com/vector_push_back.html)
  - [Hash maps](https://cppbyexample.com/hash_map.html)
  - [What are references](https://cppbyexample.com/references.html)
  - [How to find with a hash set](https://cppbyexample.com/hash_set_find.html)
- Learn C++ through an interative tutorial at [learn-cpp.org](https://www.learn-cpp.org/)
