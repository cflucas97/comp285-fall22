#### Happy Summer

Thank you for all your contributions this spring semester! Final grades have been finalized.

I plan to leave this site up for as long as possible for anyone interested in self-learning the course content!

Please reach out to me at my personal email luis [dot] perez [dot] live [at] gmail [dot] com or find me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/nautilik).

As you close this chapter in your CS education, take what you've learned and use it to propel you forward! See you all soon!
