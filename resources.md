## Zoom (Lectures and Online Sections)

We will be using [Zoom](https://ncat.zoom.us/j/9728635650) for lectures and sections during in-person lectures as well as select office hours. 

This is to help accomodate students who test positive for COVID. In general, it is expected that all students follow campus policy and attend lecture in-person.

Please make sure that you sign into Zoom with your North Carolina A&T credentials.

Please keep in mind that the lectures will be recorded and the recordings will be available on the course website.

## Piazza (Q&A)

[Piazza](https://piazza.com/ncat/fall2022/comp285) will be used for Q&A. You may ask questions about the class material, homework/lecture clarifications, logistics, etc., but *you may not post details about your own solutions publicly on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/ncat/fall2022/comp285) (public posting of your solution or code will be considered a violation of the academic integrity policy)*. If you have a specific question that might reveal aspects of your solution, please make a private post instead. We also encourage you to answer your peersâ€™ questions as well. You may also use Piazza to privately contact the course staff regarding personal concerns.

## Textbook Information

The material for the course will have a specific emphasis on preparing you for real-world engineering. We will be writing and providing detailed lecture notes and slides, along with specific resources for each assignment - as such, there's no specific textbook required for the class. 

However, here are some excellent resources you can reference:

- *Introduction to Algorithms (3rd Ed)*, Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, & Stein ([available online!](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/12846639))
- *Algorithms Illuminated*, Roughgarden (with [great videos!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcH4Ga14Y4ELFKrEYM1vXCg/playlists))
- *Cracking the Coding Interview*, McDowell, Gayle, (**great** for career prep!) [link](https://github.com/Avinash987/Coding/blob/master/Cracking-the-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition-189-Programming-Questions-and-Solutions.pdf)
