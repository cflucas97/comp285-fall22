## Overview

Intuition for deep technical skills like algorithm design is a muscle that every single one of you can meaningfully build over time. You’ll build confidence through strengthening this muscle in yourselves regardless of where you’re starting. For us to ensure that, we must embrace these core philosophies:

## Core Values

- **Grit is essential:** We will show-up to class ready to learn and devote our full attention to the course. Success is a mixture of talent, hard-work, and luck. We can only control cultivating our talent/craft with our work-ethic, and so, through exercising grit, every one of us will seek to maximize our likelihood of success by working hard, working smartly, and being well-prepared for opportunities that come.

- **Goals are golden:** We set ambitious short and long term goals and orient our efforts to achieving them. We reflect on our values and what’s important to us to inform our long term vision. We then decompose vision into short-term goals that, when we achieve them, bring us closer to our ideal state. We maintain agency in modifying short or long term goals to align with our values should they evolve.

- **Welcome feedback:** Learning to give and receive constructive feedback is an important skill to master for self-improvement. You have to be the biggest advocate for yourself and your career. We will seek to create an environment where everyone is comfortable respectfully sharing constructive (and positive) feedback with the goal of making each other better. 

- **Comparison is the thief of joy:** Everyone’s journey is uniquely theirs and no one should compare themselves to those around them. We meet ourselves where we are, set future goals based on our current status, capabilities, desires, and skills, and exercise grit and perseverance to achieve those goals. We see comparisons of goals, places in life, etc. are unwarranted and unproductive.


These are not set in stone. These can be modified or augmented as the classroom sees fit; the goal is for us all to align on core principles we each believe will aid in our collective success. Reach out to me if you have thoughts!
