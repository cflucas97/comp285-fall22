## Student Hours

- Student hours schedule can be found on the [COMP 285 Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=m5m78scf7panucng0a3fpdstik%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York).
- Student hours will take place mostly in-person, on-campus. However, a few select office hours will be made available through [Zoom](https://ncat.zoom.us/j/7927890938).


Given the restrictions to ERIC, all student hours for Week 0-4 will be held over [Zoom](https://ncat.zoom.us/j/7927890938)!

This includes the normally "in-person" student hours of:

- Monday: 1:30pm - 2:30pm in ERIC 331.
- Wednesday: 1:30pm - 2:30pm in ERIC 331.
- Friday: 1:30pm - 2:30pm in ERIC 331.

Additional online-only student hours are:

- Tuesday: 3:00 pm - 4:00pm
- Thursday: 3:00 pm - 4:00pm


### Regular Student Hours
TAs will open up their schedule to help students. Different TAs may have different ways of working through students (i.e., in groups or 1 at a time). If the location is getting too crowded, the TA may ask groups of students to work together and ask them to switch rooms. Students can work together while waiting for assistance during student hours.
